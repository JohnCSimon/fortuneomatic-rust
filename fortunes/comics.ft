  The walls of my study are covered with faces. Film faces. Actors.
Directors. Extras. Old faces I've bought in film and junk shops on
three continents. A patchwork of the nameless and the ones that
interested me, with, here and there, a sprinkling of stars.
  They are my frame of reference, the world in which I move. I can
stare at them for hours, wondering about the people behind the faces,
their lives before and after the frozen second they are trapped in.

If you bring me back to life, my death will have no meaning. I had a

And the Lady Bast, her fur thinning and her eyes milky and dim,
summons all the power at her disposal, pulls together tiny strands of
belief, a handful of instants of half-hearted worship. At a cat show

she walks to the Dreaming.

We were never loves, and we never will be, now. I do not regret that,

it. These things alone do I now regret: things left unsaid. And he is

I cared for him, very much. He was so wise; he seemed so certain of
