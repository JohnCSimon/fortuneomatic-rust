Truth never damages a cause that is just.

Unwearied ceaseless effort is the price that must be paid for turning faith into a rich infallible experience.

Violent men have not been known in history to die to a man. They die up to a point.
--Mohandas Gandhi--
We do not need to proselytise either by our speech or by our writing. We can only do so really with our lives. Let our lives be open books for all to study.
--Mohandas Gandhi--
We may have our private opinions but why should they be a bar to the meeting of hearts?
