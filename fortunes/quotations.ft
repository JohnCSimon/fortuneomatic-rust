I am a design chauvinist. I believe that good design is magical and

and a lousy one is in the meshing of the thousand details that either
fit or don't, and the spirit of the passionate intellect that has tied
them together, or tried. That's why programming -- or buying software
-- on the basis of "lists of features" is a doomed and misguided
effort. The features can be thrown together, as in a garbage can, or
carefully laid together and interwoven in elegant unification, as in

There is something about a mass-market Luxury Cruise that's unbearably
sad. Like most unbearably sad things, it seems incredibly elusive and
complex in its causes and simple in its effect: on board the _Nadir_

reassurances and gaiety-noise ceased -- I felt despair. The word's
overused and banalified now, *despair*, but it's a serious word, and
I'm using it seriously. For me it denotes a simple admixture -- a
weird yearning for death combined with a crushing sense of my own
smallness and futility that presents as a fear of death. It's maybe
close to what people call dread or angst. But it's not these things,
quite. It's more like wanting to die in order to escape the unbearable
feeling of becoming aware that I'm small and weak and selfish and
going without any doubt at all to die. It's wanting to jump overboard.

There was a blithe certainty that came from first comprehending the

tenuously to the page, a gossamer web. They seemed insubstantial when
you first saw them, a string of squiggles. Yet to follow the delicate
tensors as they contracted, as the superscripts paired with
subscripts, collapsing mathematically into concrete classical entities
-- potential; mass; forces vectoring in a curved geometry -- that was
a sublime experience. The iron fist of the real, inside the velvet
glove of airy mathematics.

The true poet and the true scientist are not estranged. They go forth
into nature like two friends. Behold them strolling through the summer
fields and woods. The younger of the two is much the more active and
inquiring; he is ever and anon stepping aside to examine some object
more minutely, plucking a flower, treasuring a shell, pursuing a bird,
watching a butterfly; now he turns over a stone, peers into the
marshes, chips off a fragment of rock, and everywhere seems intent on
some special and particular knowledge of the things about him. The
elder man has more an air of leisurely contemplation and enjoyment, is
less curious about special objects and features, and more desirous of
putting himself in harmony with the spirit of the whole. But when his
younger companion has any fresh and characteristic bit of information
to impart to him, how attentively he listens, how sure and
discriminating is his appreciation! The interests of the two in the
universe are widely different, yet in no true sense are they hostile

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of
exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an
idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps
it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into
the possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself
of it... He who receives an idea from me, receives instructions
himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine,
receives light without darkening me. That ideas should be spread from
one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of
man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly
and benevolently designed by nature...

irrelevance. What the user can end up with is little more than a
series of footnotes, marginalia, and "see also" references -- items
that have historically been relegated to second-class citizenship in
the good old book format, with the added benefit of not having to
stare at a lousy screen display to read them... Indeed, when you boil
it down to its rudiments, hypertext seems to make one major claim: it
makes computers work almost as well as books.

At least one way of measuring the freedom of any society is the amount
of comedy that is permitted, and clearly a healthy society permits
more satirical comment than a repressive, so that if comedy is to
function in some way as a safety release then it must obviously deal
with these taboo areas. This is part of the responsibility we accord
our licensed jesters, that nothing be excused the searching light of
comedy. If anything can survive the probe of humour it is clearly of
value, and conversely all groups who claim immunity from laughter are
claiming special privileges which should not be granted.

about some improvement by starting at the verbal end. If you simplify
your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You
cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid
remark, its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself. Political
language -- and with variations this is true of all political parties,
from Conservatives to Anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound
truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity
to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at

one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase -- some
*jackboot*, *Achilles' heel*, *hotbed*, *melting pot*, *acid test*,
*veritable inferno* or other lump of verbal refuse -- into the dustbin

In all such cases there is one common circumstance -- the system has a
quantity of potential energy, which is capable of being transformed
into motion, but which cannot begin to be so transformed till the
system has reached a certain configuration, to attain which requires
an expenditure of work, which in certain cases may be infinitesimally
small, and in general bears no definite proportion to the energy
developed in consequence thereof. For example, the rock loosed by
frost and balanced on a singular point of the mountain side, the
little spark which kindles the great forest, the little word which
sets the world a-fighting, the little scruple which prevents a man
from doing his will, the little spore which blights all the potatoes,
the little gemmule which makes us philosophers or idiots. Every
existence above a certain rank has its singular points: the higher the
rank the more of them. At these points, influences whose physical
magnitude is too small to be taken account of by a finite being, may
produce results of the greatest importance.

In practically any comedy or tragedy of Shakespeare one cannot read
twenty lines without being made aware that, behind the clowns, the
criminals, the heroes, behind the flirts and the weeping queens,
beyond all that is agonizingly or farcically human, and yet symbiotic
with man, immanent in his consciousness and consubstantial with his
being, there lie the everlasting data, the given facts of planetary
and cosmic existence on every level, animate and inanimate, mindless
and purposively conscious.

In the past decade or so, the women's magazines have taken to running
home-handyperson articles suggesting that women can learn to fix
things just as well as men. These articles are apparently based on the
ludicrous assumption that *men* know how to fix things, when in fact
all they know how to do is *look* at things in a certain squinty-eyed
manner, which they learned in Wood Shop; eventually, when enough
things in the home are broken, they take a job requiring them to
transfer to another home.

  Nothing ever begins.
  There is no first moment; no single word or place from which this or
any other story springs.
  The threads can always be traced back to some earlier tale, and to
the tales that preceded that; though as the narrator's voice recedes
the connections will seem to grow more tenuous, for each age will want
the tale told as if it were of its own making.
  Thus the pagan will be sanctified, the tragic becomes laughable;
great lovers will stoop to sentiment, and demons dwindle to clockwork
toys.
  Nothing is fixed. In and out the shuttle goes, fact and fiction,
mind and matter, woven into patterns that may have only this in

  In essence, the God of the Abrahamic religions has only one law,

because I say so. Even if I tell you to kill your own kid, don't
bother asking why -- I don't have to give you a reason. Just do it."
This law does not profit us. It puts those who accept it in the habit

representatives of the programming profession in the United States,

used in applications where reliability is crucial, i.e., nuclear power
stations, cruise missiles, early warning systems, antiballistic
missile defense systems. The next rocket to go astray as a result of a
programming language error may not be an exploratory space rocket on a
harmless trip to Venus: it may be a nuclear warhead exploding over one
of our own cities. An unreliable programming language generating
unreliable programs constitutes a far greater risk to our environment

nuclear power stations. Be vigilant to reduce the risk, not to

Now, think about a kid in 5th grade today. They've grown up with
Nintendo and arcade-quality games on their computers. They've grown up
with zillions of utilities which typically have been polished for
years. They've grown up with operating environments that, no matter
what we may think of them, are orders of magnitude more sophisticated
and complex than what we started with. What's their motivation to
program? It's going to be years of work before their programs can
equal the quality and capability of stuff they can get just by asking.
When I started programming, I spent a lot of time writing games. Is a
kid who's used to animated 256-color action games with sound going to
bother, when the best they can do is produce some text or a few lines
moving around on the screen? And as everything moves toward GUI-ness,
that places another obstacle in their path -- the work needed to put a
GUI on something may well be beyond them, let alone actually providing
any functionality. Sometimes I wonder if we aren't the last generation

Perhaps of even greater significance is the continuous and profound

to produce a pesticide that is safe, or even bake a loaf of bread that
is safe, if that loaf of bread contains chemical preservatives. When

In contrast, too many new programmers write as if there were no

Why do we behave like this? I believe that it is because operating
systems have had for many years the reputation of being very difficult
to write and you had better not mess with them. It's also been policy
that machines are very fast and it doesn't matter if you execute two
or three times as many instructions as necessary; by the time you've
debugged a faster version the processors will be three times as fast
as they are now anyhow. Nor does it matter (it's policy) that over-
general programs are too big. Memory's cheap. I think this attitude is
exceptionally bad. It leads to big clumsy implementations, and, when
used in a teaching environment, corrupts the minds of the young, which
isn't our proper business.

If you want to write software that's fast or portable or well
structured, despite years of evolution, you have to care about it and
put effort into it. It's easy to be sloppy, but it comes back to haunt
you. The only way to make something fast is to care about performance
from the beginning and put real effort into getting it. The only way
to keep the code clean and maintainable is to constantly put effort
into that aspect of it. Resist the temptation to make quick fixes. Or
if a quick fix just has to be done for some reason, make a point of
going back and doing it right. These things do not happen
automatically and they won't happen if you don't care about them. The
main reason why a lot of software today is bloated and complicated and
obscure and buggy is that people don't care. They may care in the
sense that if you ask them they say, "Yes, we care," but the fact is
they don't put any effort into it. They don't care enough to work on
it.

decades, long after the machines and compilers that caused their

optimizations and the software 'literature' ensures that the poor
programming styles of the past will persist (because they are
'efficient' on machines optimized for these poor programming styles)

excellent programs, and then molding compilers and machines to make
these programs efficient, rather than vice versa. Excellent programs

There were pools of light among the stacks, directly beneath the bulbs
which Philip had switched on, but it was now with an unexpected
fearfulness that he saw how the books stretched away into the
darkness. They seemed to expand as soon as they reached the shadows,
creating some dark world where there was no beginning and no end, no
story, no meaning. And if you crossed the threshold into that world,
you would be surrounded by words; you would crush them beneath your

about its holy work in earnest. She worked hard at it night and day

  What men, in their imbecility, constantly mistake for a deficiency
of intelligence in women is merely an incapacity for mastering small
and trivial tricks. A man thinks that he is more intelligent than his
wife because he can add up figures more accurately and because he
understands the lingo of the stock market, and follows the doings of
political mountebanks, and knows the minutiae of some sordid and
degrading business or profession, say soap selling or the law. But
these puerile talents are not really signs of intelligence; they are
merely accomplishments, and they differ only in degree from the
accomplishments of a trained chimpanzee.
  The truth is that the capacity for mastering them is the sign of a
petty mind, and Havelock Ellis, in his great study of English genius,
shows that men of genius almost invariably lack it. One could not
think of Shakespeare or Goethe or Beethoven multiplying 3,456,754 by
79,999 without making a mistake, nor could one think of them
remembering the price of this or that stock last July, or the number
of beans in a pound, or the freight rate on steel beams from Akron,
Ohio, to Newport News, or concerning themselves about the cost of
producing a stick of chewing gum, or the pay of street car conductors,
or the credit of some obscure shopkeeper in Memphis, Tenn, Such
idiotic concerns are beneath the dignity of first-rate minds.
  That women always try to evade them -- that they have little
capacity for the childish complexity of tricks upon which men base
their so-called business and professional skill and cunning -- this is
but one more proof of their intellectual aristocracy. They are not
stumped by such enterprises because they are difficult, but because
they are trivial.

athwart lines, grids -- and, on the scale of horizons, broad curving
lines of geographic force, the weird topographical drain-swirl of a
whole lot of ice-ironed land that sits and spins atop plates. The area
behind and below these broad curves at the seam of land and sky I

have failed, and how it has never been possible to predict for certain
how a human being will behave. History, with its endless procession of

the future.

  1. Nothing and no one is immune from criticism.
  2. Everyone involved in a controversy has an intellectual
responsibility to inform himself of the available facts.
  3. Criticism should be directed first to policies, and against
persons only when they are responsible for policies, and against their
motives or purposes only when there is some independent evidence of
their character.
  4. Because certain words are legally permissible, they are not
therefore morally permissible.
  5. Before impugning an opponent's motives, even when they
legitimately may be impugned, answer his arguments.
  6. Do not treat an opponent of a policy as if he were therefore a
personal enemy of the country or a concealed enemy of democracy.
  7. Since a good cause may be defended by bad arguments, after
answering the bad arguments for another's position present positive
evidence for your own.
  8. Do not hesitate to admit lack of knowledge or to suspend judgment
if evidence is not decisive either way.
  9. Only in pure logic and mathematics, not in human affairs, can one
demonstrate that something is strictly impossible. Because something
is logically possible, it is not therefore probable. "It is not
impossible" is a preface to an irrelevant statement about human
affairs. The question is always one of the balance of probabilities.
And the evidence for probabilities must include more than abstract
possibilities.
  10. The cardinal sin, when we are looking for truth of fact or
wisdom of policy, is refusal to discuss, or action which blocks
discussion.

  Nun 1: Sir, it is only a play... with music. Do not distress
yourself.
  Cosimo: It is only a play... with music? Does God say the same at
every death? It is only a play... with music? When I die, will someone
say the same? He was only a prince. He died. It was only a play...
with music.
  Nun 2: (Very quietly) Sir, be grateful for the music. Most of us die
in silence.

And in the end, yes, all we have is the question of whether we go with
dignity and honor, knowing that we have lived our lives with passion
and compassion in equal measure. For me, that knowledge is enough to
sustain me when the game is finally called on account of darkness.

Now it is time that we were going, I to die and you to live; but which

It is unfortunate, however, that even a well-ordered life cannot lead
anybody safely around the inevitable doom that waits in the sky. As F.

all in the end.

... don't waste too much effort in searching for conspiracies. Most of
the harm done in the world is out of stupidity, not by design. Be on
the watch for skulduggery... but don't fall into the trap of thinking
that every evil thing that occurs in the world in part of some
diabolic master plan. The notion that whatever is wrong with the world
can be blamed on somebody (never, of course, one's self) is a rather
infantile carryover from the childhood days when our parents were
thought to be all-powerful and therefore all-responsible.

The principle of maximum diversity operates both at the physical and
at the mental level. It says that the laws of nature and the initial
conditions are such as to make the universe as interesting as
possible. As a result, life is possible but not too easy. Always when
things are dull, something new turns up to challenge us and to stop us
from settling into a rut. Examples of things which make life difficult
are all around us: comet impacts, ice ages, weapons, plagues, nuclear
fission, computers, sex, sin and death. Not all challenges can be
overcome, and so we have tragedy. Maximum diversity often leads to
maximum stress. In the end we survive, but only by the skin of our
teeth.

There are men who serve us, like the consul at Trollesund. And there
are men we take for lovers or husbands. You are so young, Lyra, too
young to understand this, but I shall tell you anyway and you'll
understand it later: men pass in front of our eyes like butterflies,
creatures of a brief season. We love them; they are brave, proud,
beautiful, clever; and they die almost at once. They die so soon that
our hearts are continually racked with pain. We bear their children,
who are witches if they are female, human if not; and then in the
blink of an eye they are gone, felled, slain, lost. Our sons, too.
When a little boy is growing, he thinks he is immortal. His mother
knows he isn't. Each time becomes more painful, until finally your
heart is broken. Perhaps that is when Yambe-Akka comes for you. She is
older than the tundra. Perhaps, for her, witches' lives are as brief
as men's are to us.

When I was born, I cried myself; / when I die, others will cry. / When
I cried, others were happy; / when others cry, I too should feel joy.
/ "Alas, it passes away so fast!" / The windblown wheel, rolling like
a carriage. / They change the torch, but not the fire: / the later
flame is still the older flame. / How laughable, the people of this
world, / frantically making offerings to Buddha and immortals! /
Spiritual alchemy just exhausts the body, / and bowing in worship
hurts your head. / In the end, all return to the vastness, / like wind
whose form can never be grasped. / Indeed, when called / that is when
I'll go; / with a smile, I follow with the crowd.

Ahead, there were such sights unfolding: friends and places they'd
feared gone forever coming to greet them, eager for shared rapture.
There was time for all their miracles now. For ghosts and
transformations; for passion and ambiguity; for noon-day visions and
midnight glory. Time in abundance. For nothing ever begins. And this
story, having no beginning, will have no end.

My old cat is dead / Who would butt me with his head. / He had the
sleekest fur, / He had the blackest purr, / Always gentle with us /
Was this black puss, / But when I found him today / Stiff and cold
where he lay, / His look was a lion's, / Full of rage, defiance: / O!
he would not pretend / That what came was a friend / But met it in
pure hate. / Well died, my old cat.
