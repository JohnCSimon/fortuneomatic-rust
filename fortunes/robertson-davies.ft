... William Prynne's Histrio-Matrix, the Player's Scourge or Actor's
Tragedie (1632), a fat book of more than a thousand pages, which forms
an admirable compilation of all the Puritan arguments against the
theatre. The work is a classic of abuse and a monument to the
misplaced scholarship and zeal of its author. Unluckily for Prynne he
referred to women actors as 'notorious whores' meaning a group of
French actresses who had appeared at Blackfriars in 1629; the
reference was taken to apply to Queen Henrietta Maria and her ladies
who were about to perform a pastoral at Whitehall. She made a Star
Chamber matter of it and Prynne was fined 35,000 pounds, set in the
pillory, shorn of his ears, branded and imprisoned for life. The SL on
his cheeks he construed as Stigmata Laudis [marks of glory] and bore
bravely; it is pleasant to know that the life sentence was revoked by
the Parliament of the Commonwealth, for although Prynne was a small-
souled and cantankerous zealot with a maggot about homosexuality, he
was a courageous fighter and a master of invective.

We are approaching a millennium; the year 2000 draws on apace. The

monsters and portents as actualities any more than we need believe the

The first principle, when you don't know anything about the subject of
a thesis, is to let the candidate talk, nodding now and then with an
ambiguous smile. He thinks you know, and are counting his mistakes,
and it unnerves him. ... the second principle of conducting an oral,
... is to pretend ignorance, and ask for explanations of very simple
points. Of course your ignorance is real, but the examinee thinks you
are being subtle, and that he is making an ass of himself, and this

These petitioners had no conception of art; to them a picture was a
symbol of something else, and very readily the symbol became the
reality. They were untouched by modern education, but their government
was striving with might and main to procure this inestimable benefit
from them; anticlericalism and American bustle would soon free them
from belief in miracles and holy likenesses. But where, I ask myself,
will mercy and divine compassion come from then? Or are such things
necessary to people who are well fed and know the wonders that lie
concealed in an atom? I don't regret economic and educational advance;
I just wonder how much we shall have to pay for it, and in what coin.

As an historian I had all my life been aware of the extraordinary
importance of documents. I had handled hundreds of them: letters,
reports, memoranda, sometimes diaries; I had always treated them with
respect, and had come in time to have an affection for them. They
summed up something that was becoming increasingly important to me,
and that was an earthly form of immortality. Historians come and go,
but the document remains, and it had the importance of a thing that
cannot be changed or gainsaid. Whoever wrote it continues to speak
through it. It might be honest and it might be complete; on the other
hand it could be thoroughly crooked or omit something of importance.
But there it was, and it was all succeeding ages possessed.

She called it the Bear Chant; it was the music Gypsy bear-leaders
played or sang to their animals, but I think it was something older

valuable possession and money-spinner, but a companion and perhaps an
object of reverence. Is it unbelievable? Notice how some people talk
to their dogs and cats nowadays; the talk is usually the
sentimentality they think appropriate to a not very dangerous animal.
But how would one talk to a bear which could kill? How would one ask
it for friendship? How would one invite its wisdom, which is so unlike
the wisdom of a man, but not impenetrable by a man? This was what the

She herself was a victim of that lust for books which rages in the
breast like a demon, and which cannot be stilled save by the frequent
and plentiful acquisition of books. This passion is more common, and
more powerful, than most people suppose. Book lovers are thought by
unbookish people to be gentle and unworldly, and perhaps a few of them
are so. But there are others who will lie and scheme and steal to get
books as wildly and unconscionably as the dope-taker in pursuit of his
drug. They may not want the books to read immediately, or at all; they
want them to possess, to range on their shelves, to have at command.
They want books as a Turk is thought to want concubines -- not to be
hastily deflowered, but to be kept at their master's call, and enjoyed
more often in thought than in reality. Solly was in a measure a victim
of this unscrupulous passion, but Freddy was wholly in the grip of it.

She was a short, stout woman, shaped like a cottage loaf. A nubbin,
with a twist of whispy hair on it, formed her head; a larger nubbin
comprised her bust and upper reaches; the largest nubbin of all was
formed by her spreading hips. She must have had legs, but her skirts
concealed them. She had little to say, and it is doubtful that her
mental processes could be called thought; they consisted of a series
of dissolving views, mostly of possible disasters and misfortunes

When the time came for Pompadour herself to die, she confessed, was
given her viaticum, and was from that time forth forbidden to see her

thought to have behaved rather badly because he watched the sad

  The King had every privilege except that of being at ease. Pompadour
provided the atmosphere in which that final luxury was possible.

ceilings of Versailles. Indeed, Pompadour was not a physically ardent

Chaucer shares on the literary stock marker have been rising during

in a virtually unknown commodity (like the John Donne boom in the
twenties); occasionally an almost dead commodity bursts in new life
(as in the Trollope boom of the forties); Foreign Moderns (Sartre, de
Beauvoir, Camus, Sagan) are eagerly pushed but are apt to collapse
suddenly, wiping out those critics who have invested too heavily in
them; in the USA the Deep South and Proletarian Anguish are solid,

But I wonder if people do not attach too much importance to the first-
name habit? Every man and woman is a mystery, built like those Chinese
puzzles which consist of one box inside another, so that ten or twelve
boxes have to be opened before the final solution is found. Not more
than two or three people have ever penetrated beyond my outside box,
and there are not many people whom I have explored further; if anyone
imagines that being on first-name terms with somebody magically strips
away all the boxes and reveals the inner treasure he still has a great
deal to learn about human nature. There are people, of course, who
consist only of one box, and that a cardboard carton, containing
nothing at all.

I am sure that I would not make a good taxidermist; the temptation to
improve upon nature would certainly be too strong for me. Think how
easy it would be, when stuffing somebody's pet terrier, to slip a
couple of human glass eyes into a sockets, instead of the usual
buttons. The the owner would really be justified in saying that his
pet looked almost human. If I were stuffing this two-headed calf, for
instance, I could not resist making one head smile and the other one
frown, so that they looked like masks of Comedy and Tragedy.

As I plodded back and forth I reflected miserably upon my own
political rootlessness, in a world where politics is so important.
When I am with Tories I am a violent advocate of reform; when I am
with reformers I hold forth on the value of tradition and stability.
When I am with communists I become a royalist -- almost a Jacobite;
when I am with socialists I am an advocate of free trade, private
enterprise and _laissez-faire_. The presence of a person who has
strong political convictions always sends me flying off in a contrary
direction. Inevitably, in the world of today, this will bring me
before a firing squad sooner or later. Maybe the fascists will shoot
me, and maybe the proletariat, but political contrariness will be the

The kitten has a luxurious, Bohemian, unpuritanical nature. It eats
six meals a day, plays furiously with a toy mouse and a piece of rope,
and suddenly falls into a deep sleep whenever the fit takes it. It
never feels the necessity to do anything to justify its existence; it
does not want to be a Good Citizen; it has never heard of Service. It
knows that it is beautiful and delightful, and it considers that a
sufficient contribution to the general good. And in return for its
beauty and charm it expects fish, meat, and vegetables, a comfortable
bed, a chair by the grate fire, and endless petting.

Some people I know were telling me of a curious experience which they
had recently; they put a collection of old and rejected household
articles in their car and drove to a dump to dispose of them. While
busy at the dump, they were accosted by a strange figure, a woman of
tall and stately presence, wearing a paper crown and carrying a staff
in her hand, who strode majestically through the avenues of ashes, tin
cans, dishonoured wash-boilers and superannuated bathtubs, attended by
a rabble of admiring children. This apparition hailed my friends in a
strange, incoherent, but musical language, and her breath was richly
perfumed with bay-rum, or it may have been lilac lotion; she was in
fact as high as a kite and as mimsy as a borogrove. Having said her
say, she strode off in queenly style, and she and her raffish crew
were soon lost in the mazes of the dump... My theory is that this was
Titania, the fairy queen, fallen upon evil days, but magnificent in
ruin; or it may simply have been some rumdumb old bag with a sense of
humour. In either case the matter is worth investigating.

Sometimes there was a serious article on a hot topic, and I especially
remember one by a bishop headed "Is Nudity Salacious?" The bishop

During the years when my own daughters were pupils in this school I
attended many of these gatherings, and heard many speeches made by men
who stood where I stand at this moment. They said all sorts of things.
I recall one speaker who said that as he looked out at the girls who
were assembled to receive prizes, and to pay their last respects to
their school, he felt as though he were looking over a garden of
exquisite flowers. He was drunk, poor man, and it would be absurd to
treat his remark as though he were speaking on oath.

The usual thing -- the statistically normal thing -- is for the
speaker to tell the graduating class that they are going out into a
world torn by dissent, racked by problems of unprecedented knottiness
and difficulty, and headed for the abyss of destruction unless the
graduating class shoulders its burden and does something splendid to
put everything right. The speaker generally admits that he is at the
end of his tether: he is old, and broken on the wheel of Fate; his
decrepitude and his wounds have been received in this great battle
with the world's problems. Nothing -- absolutely nothing -- is to be
expected of him in the future. From his failing hands he throws the
torch; he plants the task of setting the world right square on the
graduating class. He says that he does it with confidence. But he is
usually so gloomy that one wonders how much his confidence is worth.
Sometimes one gets the impression that immediately after Convocation
he is going home to die.
